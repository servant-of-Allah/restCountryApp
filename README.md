### What I learned

working through this advanced level project from frontendMentor, i learned how to properly handle Api based application including error handling and structuring the app. most of the functionality added to the app were kinda basic. but the theme toggling part was new for me. i didn't use this process of changing the theme before. it was a great step i think. besides i thought of using a css framework like bootstrap or tailwind css but the css needed weren't that much. so i decided to stick with css3 in general. i got some improvements in my css too. especially in the detail country info section of the app.

### Useful resources

there were some useful resources that i found some help throughout my project. but unfortunately i didn't keep note of them.
